# Machine Learning

This directory contains various machine learning projects completed during my studies. The projects involve different machine learning techniques, with a focus on data analysis and model training. 

## Projects Overview

1. **Machine Learning Project 1: Kama, Rosa, or Canadian Wheat Seed**  
   This project involves classifying different types of wheat seeds.  
   - Format: Jupyter Notebook  
   - [Link to the notebook](https://github.com/HenriLemineur/Henri/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Machine%20Learning%20Project%201%20Kama%2C%20Rosa%20or%20Canadian%20wheat%20seed%20Henri%20Lemineur.ipynb)

2. **Machine Learning Project 2: Predicting the Power of a Wind Turbine**  
   This project focuses on predicting the power output of a wind turbine based on various environmental factors.  
   - Format: Jupyter Notebook  
   - [Link to the notebook](https://github.com/HenriLemineur/Henri/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Machine%20Learning%20Project%202%20Predicting%20the%20Power%20of%20a%20Wind%20Turbine%20Henri%20Lemineur.ipynb)

Additionally, there are several Python (.py) scripts for different machine learning tasks. These require the CIFAR-10 dataset (a collection of 10 classes of images, such as airplanes, dogs, and cats) to be present in the working directory. You can download the CIFAR-10 dataset [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, you will need Python and some common data science libraries.
