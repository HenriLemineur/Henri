# Other

This directory contains various code samples I have created during my studies for different courses. These codes are divided into three subdirectories based on the programming languages used: Fortran 90, Python, and C++.

## Directory Structure

### 1. **Fortran 90**
   This folder contains multiple codes related to numerical methods, which I have worked on during various courses. These scripts cover various algorithms and approaches I have learned and applied during my studies.

### 2. **Python**
   This folder contains different Python code examples, including:
   - An example of code for an exam, demonstrating the application of algorithms or concepts.
   - A plot illustrating the results from a specific simulation or data analysis.

   The Python codes are simple and easy to follow, demonstrating basic data analysis and machine learning techniques. For example, the code uses the **CIFAR-10** dataset for image classification tasks (including categories like airplanes, dogs, and cats). To run these scripts, ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries.

### 3. **C++**
   This folder contains:
   - A basic code to help get familiar with the C++ language.
   - A more advanced code, simulating a project using **Geant4**, which I worked on for an exam. This code involves particle simulation and radiation transport calculations.

Each subdirectory contains useful examples, ranging from beginner-level projects to more advanced simulations.
