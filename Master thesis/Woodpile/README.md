# Master Thesis / Woodpile

This directory contains the code and research related to my Master's thesis, which focuses on simulating different materials for woodpile twist structures to optimize the physical results, particularly the reflectance. The work involves parallelizing the calculations to reduce computational time.

## Directory Structure

### 1. **Code / Woodpile**
   This folder contains the core code for simulating the woodpile structure, with two versions:
   - **Séquentiel**: The code that runs calculations in a single-threaded manner.
   - **Parallèle**: An optimized version of the code that uses parallel computing to improve the performance and reduce computation time.

### 2. **Macro**
   The **Macro** folder contains:
   - An example of how to use the code, including input parameters and simulation setup.
   - A code to calculate "a", the lattice parameter for the woodpile structure.

The main objective of this research is to explore the impact of different materials on the woodpile structure's reflectance, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the simulation results through parallelization.
